**furl**'s designs are handcrafted based on modern design techniques and practices, catering to all the needs of a modern application's UI/UX. All of the components follow the same guidelines, such as the same size, spacing and typography system presets and the same color palettes to add a sense of consistency to your application.

Most of the design systems are customizable at their core (e.g. changing the size scale or default fonts), while components can also be fine-tuned and extended to suit your specific needs.
